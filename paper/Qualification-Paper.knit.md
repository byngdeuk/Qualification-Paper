Adoption of Laws Against Women Crimes - (evaw-global-database.unwomen.org)
Description: I use brand-new database for laws against women ccrimes from UN. UN WOMEN Global Database on Violence against Women provides database about laws against women crimes for 195 countries in the world. Developed in 2016, the database deals with the ways how countries address violence against women: laws, policies, budgets, services, prevention, perpetrators programmes, regional and international initiatives, monitoring and evaluation, etc. I will focus on the laws agasint women crimes because laws are the basic methods for preventing crimes. Again, the database subcategorizes laws into Constitutional Provision, Legislation, and Regulations. I use the data related to Legislation because of several reasons. First, Constitutional Provision is really hard to be changed. It means that there are less variations. Second, Regulations are usually based on legislation and less efficient than legislation. Therefore, I will focus on Legislation. 

(Citation: I have to re-write) The United Nations defines violence against women as "any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life" (General Assembly Resolution 48/104 Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against women, 1993).

Throughout the site, unless specified differently, the term "women" refers to females of all ages, including girls (UN General Assembly, 2006)

The sources of information of UN women global database on violence against women: Government reports to human rights bodies, including the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the Universal Periodic Review (UPR). Information provided by Governments in follow-up to the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing (1995), including: the outcomes of the twenty-third special session of the UN General Assembly (2000); and the national review of implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action in the context of the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (2015). Information available through official reports of other relevant United Nations entities. Government statements made at the United Nations.
